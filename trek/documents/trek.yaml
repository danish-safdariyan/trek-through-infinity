  We seek to create a niche calendar program that has various functions and 
  a consistent, aesthetically pleasing, graphical user interface. A specific 
  goal we have in mind is to create three main uses: a regular calendar, a 
  schedule manager, and a task manager. The regular calendar will include normal 
  functionality such as creating repeating events or notating important dates. 
  The schedule manager will be integrated with Cornell scheduler (as in, importing 
  a file exported from scheduler), and be very similar to the implementation of 
  scheduler. The task manager will be a normal task manager that keeps track of 
  impending tasks. The purpose of this program is to provide a time management 
  method that is easy to use and convenient as well.
